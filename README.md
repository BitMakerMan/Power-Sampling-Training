A Python implementation of Power Sampling algorithm for improving logical reasoning and consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Metropolis-Hastings autoregressive method.

## 🎯 What is Power Sampling?

Power Sampling is an advanced algorithm that improves the quality and coherence of text generated by language models. It works by:

1. **Generating** an initial text sequence
2. **Resampling** text blocks using Metropolis-Hastings
3. **Accepting** only improvements that enhance coherence
4. **Iterating** to achieve optimal quality

**Result**: More coherent, accurate, and logically structured text output.

## 🧠 How Power Sampling Works - Understanding the Algorithm

### Complete Algorithm Flow
![Power Sampling Algorithm](Doc/PowerSampling_Diagram.png)

### 🔬 The Metropolis-Hastings Method

Power Sampling uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (a technique from computational statistics) to iteratively improve text quality:

#### **Step 1: Initial Generation**
- Generate text normally with the LLM
- This gives us a starting point for improvement

#### **Step 2: Block Resampling**
- Split the text into smaller blocks (typically 16-128 tokens)
- For each block, propose alternative text
- Calculate probability scores for both original and new text

#### **Step 3: Metropolis-Hastings Decision**
- Accept the new text IF it improves overall probability
- Sometimes accept worse text to explore possibilities
- This helps avoid getting stuck in local optima

#### **Step 4: Iteration**
- Repeat the process multiple times
- Each iteration typically improves the text
- More iterations = better quality (but slower)

### Mathematical Process
![Mathematical Flow](Doc/_Mathematical_Flow.png)

### 📊 Mathematical Foundation

The acceptance probability is calculated as:

```
P(accept) = min(1, exp(α * (log P_proposal - log P_current)))
```

Where:
- `α` is the sharpening factor (typically 2.0-6.0)
- `P_proposal` and `P_current` are the probabilities

### 🎯 Why It Works

- **Focus**: The "alpha" parameter sharpens probabilities, making better text more likely
- **Exploration**: Sometimes accepts worse options to find better solutions
- **Coherence**: Evaluates text in context, not just word by word
- **Iteration**: Multiple rounds of refinement

## 📋 Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Recommended | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `alpha` | 2.0 - 6.0 | 4.0 | Sharpening factor for focus |
| `block_size` | 16 - 128 | 64 | Text block size for resampling |
| `steps` | 1 - 10 | 5 | Number of Metropolis-Hastings iterations |
| `max_len` | 128 - 512 | 256 | Maximum output length |
| `temperature` | 0.5 - 2.0 | 1.0 | Sampling temperature |

### Standard vs Power Sampling
![Comparison](Doc/PowerSampling_Comparison.png)

### Example Output Comparison

**Standard LLM Generation (125M model):**
```
What is artificial intelligence?
It depends on the internet. On mobile, for example, it can be seen as a platform to develop new technology...
```

**Power Sampling (Improved):**
```
What is artificial intelligence?
By default, the most advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI) is computer vision, in...
```

**Note:** Small models (125M parameters) have limited reasoning capabilities. For better results, use larger models like TinyLlama 1.1B or OPT-1.3B when testing Power Sampling improvements.

### ⚡ **Important Reality Check: What Power Sampling Can and Cannot Do**

**🎯 Conclusion from Realistic Testing:**

Results vary **dramatically** depending on the model used. Power Sampling **is not magic** - if the model is limited, you can't get blood from a stone.

**🧠 Power Sampling IS:**
- ✅ **Iterative coherence filter** that improves what the model already knows
- ✅ **Anti-stupidity guard** that prevents completely illogical responses
- ✅ **Enhancer** for "knowledgeable" models that already have baseline capabilities
- ✅ **Refiner** that makes text more structured and coherent

**🚫 Power Sampling is NOT:**
- ❌ **Artificial intelligence** that turns stupid → smart
- ❌ **Extra knowledge** that teaches new things to the model
- ❌ **Magic pill** that transforms a limited model into an expert
- ❌ **Universal solution** for all reasoning problems

**💡 The Truth:**
Power Sampling cannot make a limited model "intelligent," but it can **prevent it from being "stupid"** 🙂. For models with baseline capabilities (1B+ parameters), it becomes a powerful tool. For very small models (125M), it mainly helps avoid worse responses.

**🎪 Recommended Testing:**
- **125M models**: Expect marginal improvements, mainly coherence
- **345M+ models**: Start seeing real reasoning benefits
- **1B+ models**: **Maximum benefit** - where Power Sampling truly shines
